# 🗣️ How Politicians Change the Way They Talk
**Applied NLP Techniques on European Parliamentary Debates**

This project explores how politicians adapt their language in parliamentary debates, focusing on **framing, priming, rhetorical strategies, and linguistic complexity**. Using a large corpus of European parliamentary debates, I apply **NLP and data science methods** to investigate how language shapes persuasion, confidence, and decision-making.

## 🔹 Project Goals
- Measure **linguistic phenomena** such as:
  - Framing (emotional vs. factual evidence)
  - Priming
  - Euphemisms & Dysphemisms
  - Hedging & certainty words
  - Speech complexity (incl. passive vs. active voice)
- Perform **topic modeling** to detect dominant narratives.
- Conduct **sentiment analysis** on party/ideology differences.
- Build **predictive models** for voting outcomes based on linguistic features.
- Construct a **network analysis** of debate interactions.
- Analyze **narrative changes** over time, with focus on business and economy related topics.
